Then let\'s start creating an alternative by nominating someone to run as an indepedent candidate in the upcoming BC provincial election in May 2017. Maybe that person is a friend or family member you know. Perhaps theyâ€™re a community leader, your neighbour, an old boss, your professor, your doctor, a highschool teacher, that activist in the local newspaper, that colleague at work or the small business owner down the street. Maybe that person is you.',

We need independent thinkers who truly stand for interests of British Columbians and simply good governance.',

If we can, we\'ll even try to reach out to the nominee and let them know about the public support for their nomination.'
