            <h3>Imagine X issues a callout for British Columbians to crowdsource independent candidates to run in the upcoming B.C. provincial election</h3>
            <p><i>Citizen political group, Imagine X launches new candidate nomination website for British Columbians to publically nominate independent candidates</i></p>
            <p>January 17, 2016 (VANCOUVER, BC) - Imagine X, a political group in B.C., today issues a callout for British Columbians to nominate independent candidates to run in the upcoming B.C. provincial election in May 2017. British Columbians are encouraged to submit suggestions of potential candidates through Imagine X’s new online nomination platform at: <a href="/nominate">www.imagine-x.ca/nominate</a> and view a list of crowdsourced nominees at: <a href="/nominees">www.imagine-x.ca/nominees</a></p>
            <p>“British Columbia is stuck in a divisive two-party system with MLAs who prioritize party-interests over constituents’ interest. However, we strongly believe that there are frustrated voters and potentially exceptional candidates in B.C. do not find their values reflected in the current partisan options and want an alternative.” says Fred Bantados, spokesperson for Imagine X. “This is why Imagine X is issuing a callout for all British Columbians to publically nominate leaders in their communities or even themselves to run as independent candidates in the upcoming provincial election. It is time that British Columbians collectively step up to bring democracy back to the people.”</p>
            <p>Starting today, anyone can submit new nominees and endorse existing nominees on the website. Nominees must not already be affiliated with an existing political party. Submissions do not reflect the electoral intentions of the person nominated or the stage of their official nomination with Elections BC. The nomination platform is not affiliated with Elections BC and does not replace any nomination procedures required by Elections BC. The sole intention of this website is to facilitate a dialogue with the general public to encourage more people to participate in British Columbia’s democracy by running for a seat in the legislature.</p>
            <p>Over the next few months leading up to the next provincial election, Imagine X will be releasing series of initiatives that will continue to highlight and challenge the partisan polarization in B.C. politics.</p>

            <h3>First ever B.C. MLA voting records web app shows that B.C. legislature is deeply politically polarized</h3>
            <p><i>Citizen political group, Imagine X launches new interactive app for public to discover MLA voting records</i></p>
            <p>December 7, 2016 (VANCOUVER, BC) - Imagine X, a political group in B.C., today announces the release of the first ever B.C. MLA voting records web application viewable at <a href="/votes">www.imagine-x.ca/votes</a>. The interactive app tracks and visualizes voting data from the most recent provincial parliament to illustrate the stark partisan divide in the B.C. legislature. This is the first time that B.C. MLA voting records are displayed in an accessible and meaningful way for the public to consume.</p>
            <p>The app consists of data aggregated from 109 standing votes in the first to fifth sessions of the 40th provincial parliament from 2013 to 2016 as recorded by the Hansard provided by the Legislative Assembly of B.C. Outside of two isolated incidents, the voting records consistently demonstrate that MLAs from the B.C. Liberal and B.C. NDP caucuses are “whipped” - meaning that the majority of their votes seem strongly influenced by party discipline over constituency interests. As Sean Holman highlighted in his documentary, <i>Whipped: the secret world of party discipline</i>, MLAs can face severe internal and external consequences for voting against their party even when it is in their constituency’s best interests to do so. In contrast, independent members of legislature, such as Vicki Huntington of Delta-South, can exercise “free” votes that are inline with their constituency’s interests and own consciences, while balanced against the best interests of all British Columbians.</p>
            <p>Starting today, anyone can submit new nominees and endorse existing nominees on the website. Nominees must not already be affiliated with an existing political party. Submissions do not reflect the electoral intentions of the person nominated or the stage of their official nomination with Elections BC. The intention of this website is solely to facilitate a dialogue with the general public to encourage more people to participate in British Columbia’s democracy by running for a seat in the legislature.</p>
            <p>British Columbians will go to the polls next May with the hope of electing representatives who will be their voices in the legislature in Victoria. However, based on historical data, unknowing British Columbians will more likely be voting MLAs who will be representing party politics in Victoria back to them. The strength of party discipline in B.C. has created a divisive parliamentary environment that does not encourage independent thought or a citizen-centric representative democracy. As Premier W.A.C. Bennett once said “...the time has now arrived in British Columbia when members must be elected to represent constituencies and not to be party rubber stamps and jump through the hoop at the crack of the party whip in Victoria.”</p>
            <p>Over the next few months leading up to the next provincial election, Imagine X will be releasing series of initiatives that will continue to highlight and challenge the partisan polarization in B.C. politics.</p>
            <b>Quotes</b>
            <b>Fred Bantados, Spokesperson for Imagine X</b>
            <p>“As Imagine X, we want to bring public awareness to the political divisiveness and lack of independent thought in the B.C. legislature. Creating this MLA voting records app is one of our first steps. We think that accessible voting records of B.C. MLAs displayed in a meaningful way for the public to consume is vital to a healthy and transparent democracy. The data clearly shows that our current MLAs usually only vote along the party lines above all else. We need to reimagine politics and rethink how we can bring democracy back to the people in B.C.”</p>
            <b>Sean Holman, Documentary Filmmaker of <i>Whipped: the secret world of party discipline</i></b>
            <p>“Most MLAs will only ever vote and voice the party line, giving a government with a majority in the legislature the power to do whatever it wants between elections. That’s not much of a democracy, something I illustrated in my 2013 documentary, Whipped: the secret world of party discipline. As this project from Imagine X shows, not much has changed since then. But, if British Columbians do want such a change, they need to be thinking about how to elect more MLAs who will actually listen to them and their own conscience.”</p>
